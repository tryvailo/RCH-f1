# RightCareHome: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Version 2.0 - December 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision

RightCareHome is a data intelligence platform that helps UK families choose the right care home with confidence by revealing critical information that traditional care home directories hide: staff satisfaction, financial stability, fair pricing analysis, and real family engagement patterns.

### 1.2 Mission Statement

Transform the stressful, 4-6 week care home search into a confident, informed decision within 2 weeks by providing transparent, data-driven insights that put families first—not care home commissions.

### 1.3 Market Problem

- 74% of UK families struggle with understanding care home funding options
- 68% worry about being overcharged (average fees £64,000/year)
- 64% prioritize staff quality, yet no directories provide staff satisfaction data
- Average search takes 4-6 weeks visiting 3-4 homes
- Existing directories take 10-30% commissions from care homes, creating bias
