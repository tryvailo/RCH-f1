## Objection Handlers

### "£119 is expensive"
> **Consider the alternative:** 40+ hours of research, or £119 and 24 hours. Plus, our Fair Cost Gap Calculator typically identifies £3,000-8,000 in annual savings—that's 25-67x return on your investment.

### "Can't I find this information myself?"
> You can find CQC ratings online. You can't easily find FSA food safety data, family visit patterns, negotiation scripts, or funding eligibility specific to your council. We've combined 200+ data points that would take you weeks to gather.

### "How do I know it's accurate?"
> We use official data sources: CQC, Companies House, FSA, Google Places. Our methodology is fully transparent in the appendix. We don't take commissions from care homes, so our recommendations are unbiased.

### "What if I need it urgently?"
> Reports are delivered within 24 hours. If you've just received a hospital discharge notice, we understand the pressure you're under.

### "I'm not sure my family will agree"
> That's exactly why we built Share with Family. Send the report to relatives and discuss it together—no more endless email chains or confusing comparisons.
